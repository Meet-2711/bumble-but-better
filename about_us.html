      <p>BUMBLE BEE is a dating app that bills itself as letting women make
        the first move, Making a thorough, strong profile is the first step in making matches
        on it. Don’t skip past the basic information-gathering questions the app asks as you
        are creating a profile. If you have more than two photos of yourself that you like
        , use them. It allows users to upload up to six. Fill out as much information about
        yourself as you feel comfortable sharing, from work to interests. The more complete your
        profile is, the better odds of you showing up in the algorithm for potential suitors to see
        Pick which mode you want to use. “Date” is the traditional avenue for finding potential
        matches. “BFF” is a way to meet people you might want to befriend. And “Bizz” is the
        app’s networking community. </p>
